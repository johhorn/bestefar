                <h2>The Painter's View On Understanding Art of Our Time</h2>
                <p>
                    It is impossible to understand the real content and spirit of art
                    without considering the influences of their own time upon the artists.
                    If an audience ignores these elements, art will be like an enigma.
                    It will collide with, and sometimes provoke, public opinions on the
                    purpose of creating art. Art follows its own path, regardless of what
                    public opinions might think about its purpose. The real function of
                    independent art is not to decorate the wall behind your sofa. It is
                    vital to have in mind the impact upon artist and art from events and
                    drama of any present time – for better or for worse.

                <h2>The Painter's View On Man, Society and Nature</h2>
                <p>
                    Since the beginning of 1960’s the painter has been deeply involved in
                    problems concerning the decay and disintegration of human civilization.
                    Among others the following issues:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The destruction of environment and nature, and effects of industrially
                        processed food on public health; the effects of irresponsible use of
                        global resources on the coming generations; of irresponsible public
                        consumption; of growth in world population etc.
                    </li>
                    <li>

                    <li>
                        From 1965 strongly opposed to plans for adding fluorides to the drinking
                        water in Norway. Based on medical facts that fluoridation and other use
                        of fluorides is an alarming hazard to public health.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The painter has for years been a member of The International Anti-Slavery
                        Association. He considers slavery and any other kind of suppression of humans,
                        to be the crime above all crimes to man and mankind through history, and has
                        caused more suffering and deaths to much more people than all wars.
